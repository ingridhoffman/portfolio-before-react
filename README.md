# Portfolio

Welcome to my professional portfolio site. This website is intended to provide useful information about me to potential employers and/or new clients.

### User Story

```
AS A potential employer and/or client
I WANT to understand Ingrid's work experience, skills, quality of work, and personality
SO THAT I can determine if she is a good fit for our company or project
```

## Development Notes

### Build Process

1. Site structure and planning
2. HTML framework (with temporary content)
3. Desktop styling
4. Desktop functionality
5. Content
6. Mobile styling
7. Mobile functionality

### Functionality Criteria

```
IF A USER wants to view specific content on the desktop site
THERE IS a navigation bar with a link to the relevant section
IF A USER wants to view specific content on the mobile site
THERE IS a hamburger menu with a link to the relevant section
IF A USER is currently viewing a section of the site
THERE IS a clear indication in the navigation of which section is currently being viewed

IF A USER clicks a link in the navigation (mobile and desktop)
THEN the selected section scrolls into the browser window
IF A USER clicks on a project in the portfolio section
THEN detailed information for that project appears in the portfolio section
IF A USER clicks on the resume icon
THEN a pdf version of the resume opens and can be downloaded
IF A USER clicks on Contact Me
THEN a popup window opens with a friendly contact message
IF A USER clicks on a web icon
THEN my personal page for that web service opens in a new tab
```

### Known Issues

The following is a list of things I will be working on in the next few weeks (feedback and/or helpful hints are always appreciated):

- scroll snap to page sections
- use html picture tag and image source sets for better mobile browsing
- position sections at top of page when using nav links (will scroll snap work for this too?)
- article style overflow:hidden?
- verify valid email address
- functionality for send button on contact form
- custom error messages rather than alerts
- update script to ES6
- nav menu not correctly responding to current article on page (maybe this is also fixed with snap scroll?)
- selected project section should be built out to provide more project info, contributor names and urls, and flexibility for multiple images
- project images should be improved to show on various screen frames and/or be animated gifs with scrolling capabilities
- sticky footer overlaps sticky nav at start of page - perhaps Intersection Observer could be used to make it disappear until clear
- project card name maintaining large padding or margin on sides but no style seems to dictate this
- why does page scroll to middle when page is refreshed???
- autofocus not working on contact form
- need to create resume
- linkedIn needs update
- need to complete responsive design and optimizing for tablet and mobile including changing nav to hamburger at smaller screens
- overall site design needs 1-2 more iterations of revisions - flow and balance of content/whitespace needs improvement
