				<p>
					I am a full-stack web developer with an emphasis on front-end design. I am currently completing a Certificate
					for Full Stack Web Development from the University of Oregon Extension in which I am developing skills in
					responsive design, Bootstrap, Express.js, React.js, Node.js, Database Theory, Bookshelf.js, MongoDB, MySQL,
					Java, and more, as well as building a deeper knowledge on my previous experience with HTML, CSS, and
					JavaScript. I am also completing online courses in UI/UX design working in Adobe XP, Sketch, and Invision.
					These new skills layer over extensive understanding of structure, design, and innovation from my years of
					experience working in architecture and interior design.
				</p>
				<h2>At Work</h2>
				<p>
					I thrive on learning and growth, turning thoughts into action, and going above and beyond the expected
					outcome. I excel at understanding the needs and goals of projects and clients and optimizing strategies for
					successful results.
				</p>

					<li>Relator</li>

					<li>Strategic</li>
				</ul>
				<p class="right">
					I am eager to put my passion, strengths, and new skills to work for an innovative and dynamic company.
				</p>
				<h2>At Play</h2>
				<p>
					Every day my kids teach me something new that I can apply to all aspects of my life. To savor a moment hiking
					a hill or reading a book. To play at gardening or rock climbing. To let worry go and enjoy a mountain ski
					adventure or a quiet chat with friends. And of course to experience the joy of unrestrained laughter over a
					board game or experimental cocktail.

							A great project exceeds the users needs and enhances the brand image of the client. I take pride in my

							strive to translate the stated needs into an effective and forward-thinking application.

				<p>
					University of Oregon bootcamp is my first official tech developer certification program but coding concepts
					are not foreign to me. I was introduced to C++ in computer science classes at college and remember the thrill
					of creating a functioning hangman game. During my years as an independent interior designer, I learned HTML,
					CSS, and some JavaScript to create my own e-commerce website with customizable service packages.
				</p>
				<p>
					My many years of working in the architecture field have provided valuable understanding of the logic of
					structures and how to overlay design on an established frame. I have also developed a strength in turning
					iteration towards innovation. At my recent job as an Associate with LRS Architects, I managed projects and
					teams, guided project design from concept through implementation, and instigated internal evolution in the
					form of a graphic brand refresh and improved integration of architecture and interior design in the project
					process.
